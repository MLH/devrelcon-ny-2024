### What is your COVID-19 Policy?

All attendees will be required to be up to date with COVID-19 vaccines. Additionally, we ask anyone not feeling well or in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 to stay home from the conference. Unfortunately, if you cannot attend the conference due to illness, we cannot refund your ticket.

### Is there a code of conduct?

We want to make sure that DevRelCon North America creates a safe and welcoming environment for attendees, speakers and sponsors. For this reason all participants are expected to follow the [MLH Code of Conduct](https://mlh.io/code-of-conduct) throughout the duration of the conference.

### Where should I stay for DevRelCon NY?

We’d recommend reading the [Neighborhood Guide](/neighborhood). If you would like to stay walking distance from the venue, our team is staying at the Wyndham Garden Inn Sunset Park Brooklyn, however it is a much more industrial area than where our recommended hotels are.

## Transit & Directions

### How do I get to DevRelCon NY?

We recommend taking the subway to the 36th Street station in Brooklyn. The D, N, and R lines all stop at 36th St but we would encourage you to check Google Maps for up to date schedule information. From the 36th st station, there is a short (<5 minute) walk to the venue. Alternatively, you may take a ride share or taxi directly to [33 35th Street in Brooklyn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ht8BG4xB8GSJdJQY7) which we refer to as the Broadway Stage (52A).

### Is there parking available on site?

If you are driving to DevRelCon NY, you may park in the [public Industry City parking lot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MK4go7qJ3bXQNsma6) on 37th Street and 2nd Avenue. You will need to pay for your parking via the available pay stations. It costs $15 per Weekday, $5 per Weekend Day, and $5 per Weeknight after 5pm.

### How is the DevRelCon NY venue set up?

The macro venue is called Industry City, which is a converted industrial development in Brooklyn that now houses retail, coworking and event spaces, and more. Within Industry City, our keynotes and registration will be taking place on our Broadway Stage, which is referred to in Industry City as 52A and is in Building 5 in the complex. Our unconference, workshops/sessions, lunch, and our after party will be taking place in our Central Park Room (upstairs) and Brooklyn Bridge Stage (downstairs) which are in a coworking space called Camp David. Camp David is in Building 3 of the complex. There is a short (<5) min walk that is partially outdoors and partially indoors between the two spaces. You can see all of our spaces on the map below.
