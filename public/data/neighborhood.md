Sunset Park is known for its booming Chinatown, incredible food, and diverse community. The namesake park boasts Statue of Liberty views, and Industry City, our DevRelCon New York venue sits, nestled on the waterfront. Industry City offers local restaurants galore, workshops for local artists, distilleries and breweries, and so much more. We recommend you take advantage of all this area has to offer and have highlighted a few of our favorite spots below.

There is also a [DevRel community-created NYC guide](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vUTWdHi1RDh1zHGD9) on Google Maps with lots of great spots for you to check out.

# Places to Stay

We recommend grabbing a hotel room in Downtown Brooklyn, which is just one stop on the D or N train to Industry City. Downtown Brooklyn offers ample choices of hotels including the [Ace Hotel](https://acehotel.com/brooklyn/), [Even Hotel](https://www.ihg.com/evenhotels/hotels/us/en/brooklyn/bxyev/hoteldetail?cm_mmc=GoogleMaps-_-VN-_-US-_-BXYEV), [Hilton](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/nycbshh-hilton-brooklyn-new-york/?SEO_id=GMB-AMER-HH-NYCBSHH&y_source=1_MzkxMzQwMS03MTUtbG9jYXRpb24ud2Vic2l0ZQ%3D%3D), amongst plenty of others. If you prefer to stay within walking distance of the venue, there are options in the area.
